* Development Plan
- [X] Script to generate the memory block IP using the included COE file
- [X] Script to simulate looping through the memory array reading each address
- [ ] Script to simulate testing of the processor with the memory array
- [ ] Design the processor module so that it can actually

* Conventions
Use 16'd1 or 16'd3 for incrementing program counter
Use 1'b1 for things which are single bits
Increment PC immediately prior to returning to the FETCH state
Register ALU results and processor status flags on the return to the FETCH state
(i.e., the rising edge of clock in the state prior to FETCH).  This means
registering the new
