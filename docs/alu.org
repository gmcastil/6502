* Instructions
- [X] ADC (add with carry)
- [X] AND (bitwise AND with accumulator)
- [X] ASL (arithmetic shift left)
- [ ] BIT (test BITs)
- [ ] CMP (compare accumulator)
- [ ] CPX (compare X register)
- [ ] CPY (compare Y register)
- [X] DEC (decrement memory)
- [X] EOR (bitwise exclusive or)
- [X] INC (increment memory)
- [X] LSR (logical shift right)
- [X] ORA (bitwise or with accumulator)
- [X] ROL (rotate left)
- [X] ROR (rotate right)
- [X] SBC (subtract with carry)

Necessary operations:
- Addition
  - BCD addition
  - Concerns with 2's complement?
  - Needs to cover:
    - [ ] Add with carry
    - [ ] Increment operations
- Subtraction
